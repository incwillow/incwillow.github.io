            <h1>VR/AR tabletop game in Unity for Google's Cardboard</h1>

            <h2>Virtual Reality is going to be huge.</h2>
            <p>A quick internet search for "VR 2015" will show you how it's all the rage for this year and next to come.</p>
            <p>And they should be talking about it, because it is pretty awesome.</p>
            <p>Most of the game projects, though, involve a complete VR immersion so far. <strong>Very little has been done with Augmented Reality in mind</strong>. Very little has been done with AR <em>at all</em>, which always baffles us when we think about it.</p>
            <p><em>It's a lot of work</em>. The solutions are out there (we have a working one that we've put together over a weekend), but they need a lot of refinement. We can do that, yeah, but we need your help with everything else.</p>
            <p>The flipside is, we can definitely get a cool <strong>simple PoC within three months</strong> if we get the help we need.</p>

            <h2>We need people.</h2>
            <p>That's it. If you know Unity, UX/UI, modelling, rigging or animating (specially the last three) that would be amazing since we are very strong as developers already. But what we really want is cool, invested, passionate people, doesn't really matter at what.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>A strong PoC</h3>
                    <p>Being a tabletop, a lot of the AI and scenarios that an usual game requires will not be necessary. That leaves us with a lot more  room and time than we normally would to build a strong gameplay and a stuning visual experience</p>    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>You get to decide</h3>
                    <p>The project is open right now. Sure, we have tons of ideas for what the game design and how the art should look like, but we are leaving it undecided because we don't want people to do what we want, we want to reach a decision as a team</p>    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Experience and Talent</h3>
                    <p>Not to brag too much but all of us have been doing this for a while now. I, for one, have been at it for over a decade (hello Unity for mac only). We want to teach people what we know - and really want to learn from them things that we don't</p>    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>We ACTUALLY need you</h3>
                    <p>We are starting up. We are few. We know we need people to grow and make this happen. We fully expect to hire (and pay!) interns if this becomes more than a PoC</p>    
                </li>

            <p>From mobile games, to advergames, to applications, we are a small team with a very broad set of skills and experiences. Here are three of the more relevant to this project</p>
